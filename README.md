## What's New

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the full list of changes across all releases.

---

✅ **Native Desktop App**: Cross-platform application with system tray integration and single instance lock

✅ **Audiobook Library**: Browse your Storytel library with cover art and progress tracking. Supports real-time search by title, author, or narrator (Ctrl/Cmd+K shortcut)

✅ **Audio Player**: HTML5 audio player with playback controls and bookmarks

✅ **Session Management**: Storytel sessions stay in Electron's main process and are encrypted with the operating system's credential protection through Electron `safeStorage`

✅ **Internationalization**: Multi-language support (i18next) with automatic language detection

✅ **Cross-Platform**: Available for Windows, macOS (x64/ARM64), and Linux (x64/ARM64/ARMv7)

✅ **Action Logging**: Internal logging of HTTP requests, responses, and user actions, exportable for debugging. Log rotation is applied automatically (max 10 MB per file, up to 5 archived files)

✅ **Development Mode**: Hot reload for both client and server during development

✅ **Offline Listening**: Download audiobooks for offline playback

## Architecture

The application is built with TypeScript and follows a modular architecture:

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite (port 3000 in dev mode)
- **Backend**: Fastify server with TypeScript and RESTful API (port 8080)
- **Desktop**: Electron 38+ with TypeScript
  - Window Manager: Main window handling with development/production modes
  - Tray Manager: System tray integration
  - Server Manager: Embedded Fastify server management
  - IPC Manager: Inter-process communication between Electron and React
- **Authentication**: Expiring sessions encrypted with Electron `safeStorage`; the renderer cannot read or replace credentials
- **Audio Streaming**: Direct integration with Storytel's streaming API
- **Logging**: In-memory and file-based (app.log in the config directory) logging of system events and HTTP traffic

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ (see `.nvmrc` for the recommended version)
- npm 7+

## Installation

### macOS

#### Homebrew (Recommended)

To add our tap, run:

```bash
brew tap debba/storytel-player
```

Then install:

```bash
brew install --cask storytel-player
```

[![Homebrew](https://img.shields.io/badge/Homebrew-Repository-orange?logo=homebrew)](https://github.com/debba/homebrew-storytel-player)

#### Direct Download

macOS users who download directly from releases may need to run:

```bash
xattr -c "/Applications/Storytel Player.app"
```

after copying the app to the Applications directory.

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S storytel-player-bin
```

## Updates

### Automatic Updates

Automatic updates are disabled by default in this hardened fork because personal Windows builds are unsigned. Install reviewed builds manually. Release maintainers with signed artifacts can explicitly enable update checks by launching with `STORYTEL_ENABLE_AUTO_UPDATES=true`; Windows update signature verification remains enabled.

### Manual Updates

Build from the reviewed source or download a release from this fork's Releases page and verify its published checksum before installing.

## Development

Start the development environment with hot reload:

```bash
npm run install-all
npm run dev
```

This will:
- Start the Fastify server on port 3001 (with tsx watch for auto-restart)
- Start the Vite development server on port 3000
- Both servers will reload automatically when files change

### Individual Components

You can also run components separately:

```bash
# Start only the server (development mode)
npm run server:dev

# Start only the client
npm run client

# Start both (without hot reload)
npm start
```

### Electron Development

To run the Electron app in development mode:

```bash
npm run electron:dev
```

## Building

### Build for Production

Build all components for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command builds the React client with Vite (`client/build/`).

### Build Electron App

Create distributable Electron packages:

```bash
# Build and create installer/distributable for current platform
npm run electron:dist

# Platform-specific builds
npm run electron:dist:win           # Windows (x64)
npm run electron:dist:mac:x64       # macOS (Intel)
npm run electron:dist:mac:arm64     # macOS (Apple Silicon)
npm run electron:dist:linux         # Linux (all targets)
npm run electron:dist:linux:x64     # Linux x64 (tar.gz, deb, rpm, AppImage)
npm run electron:dist:linux:arm64   # Linux ARM64
npm run electron:dist:linux:arm     # Linux ARMv7
```

The built applications will be available in the `dist/` directory.

**Build targets:**
- **Windows**: NSIS installer (.exe)
- **macOS**: DMG package (.dmg)
- **Linux**: AppImage, deb, rpm, Pacman packages

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory:

```env
# Add your environment variables here
# See server/.env.example for reference
```

### Electron Builder

Electron Builder configuration is in `package.json` under the `build` key:

- **App ID**: `com.storytel.player`
- **Product Name**: `Storytel Player`
- **Output Directory**: `dist/`

## Development Notes

- The Electron app features a compact UI (480x800 window size) optimized for desktop use
- Single instance lock prevents multiple app instances from running simultaneously
- In development mode, the app connects to local dev servers (React on port 3000, Fastify on port 3001)
- In production mode, the app serves static files from `client/build/` and runs the bundled server
- The embedded Fastify server is managed by the Electron main process
- TypeScript is used throughout the project (Electron, React, and Fastify)
- Certificate errors are ignored in development mode for local HTTPS testing

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite, i18next, Axios
- **Backend**: Fastify 5, TypeScript, @fastify/cors, dotenv
- **Desktop**: Electron 38+, electron-store
- **Build Tools**: Vite, esbuild, electron-builder, TypeScript compiler
- **Development**: Concurrently, tsx (for server watch mode)
